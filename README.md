# UltraSense

This repository provides access to the following tools:

<b>PulseRadar</b>

Android application which is capable of recording sound files while emitting a constant 20kHz signal.
Use this to record your own wave files when trying out ultrasound sensing.

<b>Matlab scripts</b>

Scripts to anaylze the recorded wave file. Mainly includes FFT and calculation of doppler broadening around the 20kHz band.

<b>Audio samples</b>

To get you started, we also included some of the audio files we used in our paper. These were recorded using the microphone of a Samsung Galaxy S3.
