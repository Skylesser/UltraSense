# UltraSense

This repository provides access to the following tools:

<b>PulseRadar</b>

Android application which is capable of recording sound files while emitting CW and FMCW signals.
Use this to record your own wave files when trying out ultrasound sensing.
You can specify signal parameters in the settings. Note however that the computation and display of the spectrogram is optimized for frequency around 20kHz.

<b>Matlab scripts</b>

Scripts to anaylze the recorded wave file. Mainly includes FFT and calculation of doppler broadening around the 20kHz band.

<b>Audio samples</b>

To get you started, we also included some of the audio files we used in our paper. These were recorded using the microphone of a Samsung Galaxy S3.
